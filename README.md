## Pull Requests

The idea is to create a repo with an empty main branch. 
Then add all your code on a new branch. Then create a pull request
so that your entire project is part of the pull request.

1. code up your project as usual
2. create git repo and publish on github without any content added
3. create a new branch
4. add all project files to a commit on the new branch
5. publish the new branch on github
6. initiate pull request on github
