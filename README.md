## Pull Requests

The idea is to create a repo with an empty main branch. 
Then add all your code on a new branch. Then create a pull request
so that your entire project is part of the pull request.

1. make a new folder for the project (windows explorer)
2. open it in vscode
3. initialize a git repo (source control tab or use the command line: ```git init```)
4. make a readme and add it to an initial commit, and publish branch
5. create a new branch to work from (```git checkout -b branch-name```)
6. code up your project, commit as you go
7. publish new branch
8. make a pull request
